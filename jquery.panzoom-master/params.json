{"name":"jQuery.panzoom","tagline":"A jQuery plugin for panning and zooming elements using CSS3.","body":"### Drag and zoom any element\r\n\r\nView the [demo](demo/) or the [tests](test/).\r\n\r\nPanzoom is a progressive plugin to create panning and zooming functionality for an element. Panzoom supports the same browsers as jQuery 2.0 and can be used with jQuery 1.9.0+ or jQuery 2.0+.\r\nRather than setting width and height on an image tag, Panzoom uses CSS transforms and matrix functions to take advantage of hardware/GPU acceleration in the browser, which means the element can be _anything_: an image, a video, an iframe, a canvas, text, WHATEVER.\r\n\r\nIE<=8 is not supported, but this plugin is future-proof.\r\n\r\n### Mobile support\r\n\r\nPanzoom includes support for touch gestures on iOS and Android and even supports __pinch gestures__ for zooming. It is perfectly suited for both mobile and desktop browsers. You'll be amazed at how well this performs on your mobile device.\r\n\r\n### SVG support\r\n\r\nPanzoom supports panning and zooming SVG elements directly, in browsers that support SVG.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\nPanzoom depends on jQuery and [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) for its touch gesture support detection.\r\nIf Modernizr is not included, touch gestures will simply not be used and it will fail silently.<br>\r\nHowever, mobile behavior is not supported without Modernizr and its touch support feature detect.\r\n\r\n### More info\r\nPanzoom is incredibly customizable (including optional containment for dragging). For more information, documentation is available in the [README](blob/master/README.md).\r\n","google":"UA-41553246-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
